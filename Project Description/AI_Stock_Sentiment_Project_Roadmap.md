# 💸 AI Stock Sentiment + Price Movement Predictor

A 3-phase project roadmap to build, scale, and architect an AI-powered financial intelligence system that predicts stock price movements based on market sentiment.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core MVP (3 Weeks)

### 🎯 Goal:
Build a basic working system that takes news headlines and predicts sentiment + links it to historical stock trends.

### 📅 WEEK 1: Data Collection + Preprocessing
- Use `NewsAPI`, `Reddit API`, or Kaggle datasets (news + stock prices)
- Fetch financial news or tweets for selected stocks
- Collect historical stock price data (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage API)
- Preprocess text data (remove noise, tokenize, clean)
- Align sentiment data with stock prices

### 📅 WEEK 2: Sentiment Analysis + Feature Engineering
- Use `VADER` or `TextBlob` for basic sentiment scoring
- Link news sentiment to stock tickers
- Feature engineering: combine sentiment, price trends, volume
- Visualize sentiment trends vs price movement (matplotlib/seaborn)

### 📅 WEEK 3: Basic ML Model + Frontend
- Train simple models: Linear Regression / XGBoost for prediction
- Display price + sentiment + prediction on Streamlit app
- Build dashboards: Stock search → sentiment score → predicted movement
- Deploy on Render or Hugging Face Spaces

### 🧠 AI Concepts Used
- Text Sentiment Analysis (VADER)
- Time Series Basics (Lag features)
- Regression Models (XGBoost)
- Streamlit + API Deployment

## 🔁 Phase 2: Scaled AI System (Next 3-Week Break)

### 🎯 Goal:
Use advanced NLP and time-series models. Add deeper ML and evaluation components.

### 📅 WEEK 1: Switch to Transformer-based Sentiment
- Use `FinBERT` or `DistilBERT` fine-tuned on finance text
- Compare model outputs to VADER baseline
- Introduce aspect-based sentiment (earnings, market outlook, etc.)

### 📅 WEEK 2: Better Time-Series Modeling
- Use LSTM or GRU to model sequence of stock prices
- Input: Previous n days of stock + news sentiment features
- Output: Predicted next-day price or direction

### 📅 WEEK 3: Evaluation + Tuning
- Add performance metrics: RMSE, MAPE, precision/recall for movement
- Backtest predictions against real historical prices
- Improve UX: Add plotly charts, user input selection, model switcher

### 🧠 AI Concepts Used
- Transformers (FinBERT)
- Sequence Models (LSTM, GRU)
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Fine-tuning + Backtesting

## 🚀 Phase 3: Architected AI Platform (Long-Term Project)

### 🎯 Goal:
Make it a production-ready platform with real-time data, scaling, and advanced AI logic.

### 🔥 Features:
- Live News Feed + Real-Time Stock Prices (WebSockets or Kafka)
- Data pipelines using Airflow or Prefect
- MLflow/Weights & Biases for model tracking
- Docker + Kubernetes deployment for scalability
- Add Trading Strategy Layer (Reinforcement Learning or Rule-Based)
- Optional: GPT-powered advisor that explains trends in plain English

### 🧠 Advanced Concepts:
- Real-Time Streaming (Kafka, WebSockets)
- MLOps (MLflow, CI/CD, Monitoring)
- Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP)
- RL for trading strategy (DQN or PPO)
- Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
